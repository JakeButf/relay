Relay is an open-source IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). Designed for mobile first, but supports browser using a TCP Websocket bridge.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakeButf/relay.git
   cd relay
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   This will launch the Expo development tools. You can then run the app on an emulator or physical device using the Expo Go app. For browser development, you will need a locally running TCP/Websocket bridge.
